## Project Briefing

This is a chat application created in Express, Jquery and Tachyons CSS. It is the second chat based application I've worked on in the past week. This is different from the other app which I created in MEVN stack in a way that it does not have authentication, it does not have a complete front-end written in a modern JS framework. Instead, Jquery has been used to write front-end socket functions to interact with back-end socket events.

The project is inspired by a similar project which I came across in a Node and Express course by Brad Traversy.

## Built With
